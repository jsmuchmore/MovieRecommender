### Data Cleaning and Feature Creation

-- __Image Processing__ --

The idea behind image processing for this project was to generate numerical values for the poster for each movie in order to be used as features for machine learning. We defined two values as follows: 

__Darkness:__ Average of the RGB values within the entire image.  
__Colorfulness:__ Find the variance for each R, G and B values individually for the entire image and then take the average. 

The posters were given to us in a "poster path" meaning the tail end of a url which was to be concatenated with a "base" url. The bulk of the work for this task is done in a single loop. This loop first creates the image url from the path and base, then reads the image using io.imread from skimage. Once the image is read, the color values are individually exctracted to have the variance calculated and those variance values then averaged and sent to a colorfulness list. A darkness list is also generated by simply averaging all the color values in the image. An exception was implemented in this loop to catch invalid URLs. 

After these colorfulness and darkness values are in lists, the poster path values in the dataframe are removed and the image processing values added. The dataframe is then saved for later use. 

-- __Date Extraction__ --

The dates in our data were given as a single string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD". We thought it would be more useful to separate this into individual Year, Month and Day values. 

This was accomplished by looping through the dates and splitting the string at "-" then appending each Year, Month, Day to appropriate lists. An exception was needed to append nan as a placeholder for missing dates. After checking that everything is the correct length and in the appropriate lists, the release_date column in our dataframe was replaced with release_year, release_month and release_day and saved for later use.
